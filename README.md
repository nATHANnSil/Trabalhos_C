# Trabalhos_C
On this repository you'll find some projects I've made using C.

The purpose of the exercises, is written as a comment, either in the beginning of the file, just below the command to include libraries to the file or below the indication of the number of the exercise. On both cases I haven't translated it to English.

The file "main_TP.c" is the last project I've made on the university. Basically it's a system for a car rental store.
